# Arduino Jtagger Driver for Low Level Purposes

## Brief
Simple low level JTAG driver implemented on the Arduino platform.
Coontrolled by a python3 host via the serial UART interface of the Arduino.

## Notice
Unstable for Arduino-Uno, because of low data segment memory.
Use a different platform with more than 2KBytes of SRAM. (For example: Mega, Due ...)
